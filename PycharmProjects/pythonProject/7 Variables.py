# Variable in Python:
abc = "It's a string variable"
_abcnum = 40 # It is an example of int variable
abc123 = 55.854 # It is an example of float variable
print(_abcnum + abc123) # This will give sum of 40 + 55.854


# type() Function in Python:

print(demo3) #It will print that data type
print(type(demo2)) #It will give output as int type
